        <p>
          My friend and I are travel lovers living in CÃ´te D'azur in France.
          With a shared passion for adventure, sports, photography, and
          discovering different cultures, we embark on weekly travel and hiking
          expeditions. Our desire is to connect with like-minded individuals who
          share their passions for exploration, outdoor activities, and diverse
          cultures. We will bond over adrenaline-pumping sports, discovering
          hidden gems, and exchanging stories and languages. Together, we will
          create unforgetable memories, forge lasting friendships.
        </p>
        <p>We are able to speak: English, French, Vietnamese</p>
